## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (v8 or higher)
- **Firebase account** with a project set up

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Volunteer-Management-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
4. Create a web app in your Firebase project
5. Copy the Firebase configuration

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 5. Database Setup

The application will automatically create the necessary collections in Firestore when you first run it. The main collections are:

- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `volunteers` - Volunteer profiles and information
- `residents` - Resident profiles and preferences
- `calendar_slots` - Session scheduling and management
- `appointments` - Appointment records
- `attendance` - Attendance tracking
- `matching_rules` - AI matching algorithm configuration
- `reports` - Generated reports
- `external_groups` - External group visit management

### 6. Initialize Manager Account

Before running the application, you need to create the first manager account:

```bash
npm run init-manager
```

This script will guide you through creating a manager account with:
- Username and full name
- Secure password (automatically hashed)
- Proper role assignment

The script includes validation and will prevent duplicate usernames. After creation, you can use these credentials to log in as a manager.

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 8. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
